Explanation and Key Concepts:

    Dependencies:

        web3: The core JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. You'll need to install it: npm install web3.

    Configuration:

        YOUR_ETHEREUM_NODE_URL: Replace this with the URL of your Ethereum node provider (Infura, Alchemy, a local node, etc.).

        FACTORY_ADDRESS: The address of the Uniswap V2 Factory contract on the network you're targeting (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet).

        factoryABI and pairABI: You'll need to save the ABI (Application Binary Interface) of the Factory and Pair contracts into JSON files (./abis/IUniswapV2Factory.json and ./abis/IUniswapV2Pair.json). You can usually find these on Etherscan or in the Uniswap V2 core repository.

        TRADING_WALLET_ADDRESS and TRADING_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY: Crucially, replace these with your actual trading wallet address and private key. Never hardcode your private key in production code. Consider using environment variables or a more secure method for managing your private keys.

        NEW_CONTRACT_BLOCK_THRESHOLD: Defines how recently a pair must have been created to be considered "new."

        MIN_LIQUIDITY_THRESHOLD: Sets a minimum liquidity level for the bot to consider trading.

    getCurrentBlock(): Fetches the latest block number from the blockchain.

    getTokenSymbols() (Optional): A helper function to get the token symbols for better logging.

    getPairLiquidity(): Fetches the liquidity reserves of a given pair contract using the getReserves() function.

    executeBuyTrade() (Placeholder):

        This is a highly simplified example. You will need to replace this with your actual trading logic.

        Real-world trading involves interacting with a DEX Router contract (e.g., the Uniswap Router). You'll need its address and ABI.

        You'll need to construct the correct transaction data to call functions on the Router (like swapExactETHForTokens, swapTokensForExactETH, etc.).

        Consider slippage tolerance, gas price strategies, and error handling.

        The example uses web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction, which requires signing the transaction with your private key.

    monitorNewContracts():

        Creates a web3.eth.Contract instance for the Uniswap V2 Factory.

        factoryContract.events.PairCreated(): Listens for the PairCreated event emitted by the Factory contract whenever a new pair is created.

        Event Handling: When a PairCreated event is received:

            Extracts the token0Address, token1Address, and pairAddress from the event.

            Checks if the pair was created recently (within the NEW_CONTRACT_BLOCK_THRESHOLD).

            Logs information about the new pair.

            Mempool "Parsing" (Simulation): Subscribes to pending transactions using web3.eth.subscribe('pendingTransactions'). This is a basic way to see transactions entering the mempool. It filters for transactions that involve the new pair's address or the token addresses. This is not true, deep mempool parsing. Real mempool parsing is significantly more complex and often requires using specialized tools or infrastructure.

            Liquidity Check: Calls getPairLiquidity() to get the initial liquidity of the new pair.

            Basic Trading Logic: If the liquidity is above the MIN_LIQUIDITY_THRESHOLD, it calls the executeBuyTrade() function (which you need to implement).

            Unsubscribe: Unsubscribes from pending transactions after a short period to avoid excessive logging.

    Running the Monitor: Calls monitorNewContracts() to start the process.

Important Considerations and Caveats:

    Security: Protect your private key! Never hardcode it in production. Use environment variables or a secure key management solution.

    Gas Costs: Executing transactions on the Ethereum network costs gas. Be mindful of gas prices and set appropriate gas limits for your transactions.

    Slippage: When trading on DEXs, be aware of slippage (the difference between the expected price and the executed price). You'll need to handle slippage in your trading logic.

    Front-Running: This strategy is vulnerable to front-running bots. Other bots might see your pending transaction in the mempool and execute a similar trade before yours, potentially reducing your profits.

    Mempool Complexity: The mempool "parsing" in this example is very basic. Real-time and accurate mempool analysis is a complex topic.

    Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to catch potential issues like network errors, contract reverts, and unexpected data.

    Rate Limiting: Be aware of rate limits on your Ethereum node provider.

    Contract Verification: Always verify the addresses and ABIs of the contracts you are interacting with.

    Testing: Thoroughly test your trading logic on a test network (like Goerli or Sepolia) before deploying it to the mainnet.


To use this code:

    Create an abis directory: mkdir abis

    Save the ABIs: Save the Factory and Pair contract ABIs as IUniswapV2Factory.json and IUniswapV2Pair.json in the abis directory. You can get these from Etherscan or the Uniswap V2 core repository.

    Configure: Replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration.

    Run the script: node uniswap_monitor.js
